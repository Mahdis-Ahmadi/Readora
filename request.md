I have an assignment for my Data Science class at university. I need to do a project for this assignment. 
I want to train a recommendation system which is an ALS model. For this project I have downloaded a dataset containing 
3 tables and put them in the project directory named amazon_bookshop_recommendation_system. I have created a database
and import my dataset into the database. The name of each table is: Users, Books, and Ratings. Also, the name of the 
database is user_rate_book.db. Here is an overview of my project:
firstly, I need a Python code that does an EDA report saved as a csv, a data analysis report saved as a csv and all 
other report needed for this project. I want this recommendation system to recommend books to the users based on their 
ratings on the other books. Here we can Use collaborative filtering for the recommendation system based on ratings, 
Book-Author, Book-Title, Publisher or any other useful data. After training the model and developing the recommendation 
system, I need a Streamlit web application and design it like the Amazon page but way too simpler (just one page), that
has search box for search all the books' titles stored in the database, a login page. I need 6 sample credentials that
when I log in with the credential A for the user A, the recommendation system recommends books that I may like based on
the books I rated highly earlier as user A, and if I log in with the credential B for the user B, the recommendation 
system recommends books that I may like based on the books I rated highly earlier as user B. This was an explanation 
that for developing it we have User-ID. Also, I want to see my rating analysis when I log in with those 6 sample
credentials. For instance the User-ID 13 has the credentials A and when this user logs in they will see an analysis of 
their ratings and the books title they were interested in (for instance, books with 9 or 10 ratings), and if the 
User-ID 15 has the credentials B and when this user logs in they will see an analysis of their ratings and the books 
title they were interested in (for instance, books with 9 or 10 ratings). Please do the EDA and other initial 
analyses in details and prepare a comprehensive result. Also, please train the model with high precision and design
the Streamlit UI beautifully. If there is any other points left please tell me, and then start doing the project.
